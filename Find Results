   64  <p>A pacakge of R markdown templates.</p>
   65: <p>Currently, there’s one <code>hrbrmrkdn::default</code> :-)</p>
   66  <p>When you use RStudio to create a new R Markdown document, select “From Template” and choose “hrbrmstr’s Default Template”.</p>
   67  <p>Alternately, you could just start a blank R markdown document and replace the YAML with:</p>
   ..
   70  author: &quot;Some Author&quot;
   71  date: &quot;2016-01-21&quot;
   72: output: hrbrmrkdn::default
   73  ---</code></pre>
   74: <p>There is currently only the <code>hrbrmrkdn::default</code> template that uses <a href="http://getskeleton.com">Skeleton</a> instead of Bootstrap, auto-places headers/footers and formats the author &amp; date metdata a bit differently. You can see a sample of it <a href="http://rpubs.com/hrbrmstr/dissolvingpolygons">on RPubs</a> and you can see how responsive it is <a href="http://rud.is/projects/dissolving_polygons.html">here</a> (the RPubs surrounding HTML makes the actual created HTML report non-responsive).</p>

    7  Captain John Sheridan: You know, I just had a thought. You've been back and forth to your world so many times since you got here. How do I know you're the same Vorlon? Inside that encounter suit you could be anyone. Kosh Naranek: I have *always* been here. Captain John Sheridan: Oh, yeah? You said that about me too. Kosh Naranek: Yes. [starts to walk away] Captain John Sheridan: I really *hate* it when you do that. Kosh Naranek: [turns around] Good! Delenn: I am Grey. I stand between the candle and the star. We are Grey. We stand between the darkness and the light. Lt. Corwin: Do we trust no-one then? Cmdr. Susan Ivanova: No, trust Ivanova, trust yourself, anybody else, shoot'em. Ta'Lon: Congratulations citizen G'Kar. You are now a religious icon. Susan Ivanova: So the next time we find out where the Shadows plan to strike, we can mine the area, and as soon as they come out of hyperspace... Citizen G'Kar: Then, as you so concisely say, Boom!
